# jfx-stressnum
This repository contains a Stress Number Detector made using JavaFX. The user can record positive or negative feeling numbers by incrementing/decrementing them (on a scale of 1 to 10), and there is also an alert function to tell the stress condition based on the number.

# How does it work?
The positive and negative feeling level numbers are initialized to 0. The user can increment or decrement them using buttons for increase/decrease from a scale of 1 to 10. In the file menu, the user can check the stress condition based on the difference between the positive and negative feeling numbers. There is also a function to reset these numbers back to 0.
